# My Portfolio Site

http://www.jackdoyle.me/

I have created a portfolio to showcase my skills and projects. To achieve this, I implemented it using the following - 


## Javascript 
I created functions to animate the navbar or the section titles, depending on the scroll position on the page.

### ReactJS
A JavaScript Library that makes it painless to create interactive UIs.

<br>

## Icons
### React Icons 
Icon set from different source like FontAwesome, Material Icons, HeroIcons etc.

<br>

## Styles 

### BEM methodology 
Structured code that's easy to understand and easily scalable

### Sass
Enabled me to break different components down into separate Sass files, with the potential to re-use elements in future projects.

### TailwindCSS
A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.


### CSS Grid & Flexbox 
I created fluid layouts throughout the page with a mixture of Grid and Flexbox. The app is fully responsive on multiple screen widths.


## Contact Form
### getform.io
I use their endpoint to collect messages sent from the contact form.
