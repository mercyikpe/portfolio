# My Portfolio Site

http://www.jackdoyle.me/

I have created a portfolio to showcase my skills and projects. To achieve this, I implemented it using the following - 


## ReactJS
A JavaScript Library that makes it painless to create interactive UIs.


## BEM methodology 
Structured code that's easy to understand and easily scalable

## React Icons
Icons set from different source like FontAwesome, Material Icons, HeroIcons etc.

## Sass
Enabled me to break different components down into separate Sass files, with the potential to re-use elements in future projects.


## CSS Grid & Flexbox 
I created fluid layouts throughout the page with a mixture of Grid and Flexbox. The app is fully responsive on multiple screen widths.



## JavaScript
I created functions to animate the navbar or the section titles, depending on the scroll position on the page.


## Github pages Server
Used github pages to host the site
